    /**
     * This function finds the kth smallest prime fraction from an array of integers.
     *
     * The function uses a binary search approach to find the kth smallest fraction. It starts with a range
     * of possible fractions between 0 and 1 (inclusive). It then calculates the middle of this range and counts
     * the number of fractions that are less than or equal to this middle value. If the count is less than k,
     * it means the kth smallest fraction is greater than the middle value, so it adjusts the range to be between
     * the middle value and 1. If the count is greater than k, it means the kth smallest fraction is less than
     * or equal to the middle value, so it adjusts the range to be between 0 and the middle value. If the count
     * is exactly k, it means it has found the kth smallest fraction and it returns this fraction.
     *
     * @param arr the array of integers from which to find the kth smallest prime fraction.
     * @param k the rank of the smallest prime fraction to find.
     * @return an array of two integers representing the kth smallest prime fraction.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if `arr` is empty or `k` is not within the valid range.
