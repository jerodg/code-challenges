/**
 * @brief Computes the score of a binary matrix after flipping.
 *
 * The function flips each row of the matrix so that the leftmost bit of each row is 1. Then, it flips columns to maximize the number of 1s.
 * The score of the matrix is the sum of the binary numbers represented by each row.
 *
 * @param grid The 2D binary matrix.
 * @param r The number of rows in the matrix.
 * @param gridColSize The number of columns in the matrix.
 * @return int The score of the matrix after flipping.
