This folder contains input files to test your program.
You may modify these files or add your own - they are purely for debugging.

Each JSON file contains a dictionary with input parameters to your program.
For example:
    {
        "window_string": "X=5 H=10 Y=0 W=20"
    }

To test your program using the JSON file run:
    python test_answer.py ./inputs/window_2.json

This calls answer() in answer.py as follows:
    answer(window_string)
