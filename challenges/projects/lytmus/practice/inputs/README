The files in this folder are provided for your own convenience.
You are free to modify the existing files, and add your own test files.

Each test file must contain a JSON-encoded dictionary, for example,
    {
        "ip_address": "10.43.125.38",
        "use_strict_validation": true
    }

Running such test file with your program will invoke your
`answer()` function as follows:

    answer("10.43.125.38", true)

and dump the return value to a file called 'output.json' and stdout.
