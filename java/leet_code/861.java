     * This method calculates the maximum score that can be obtained from a binary matrix.
     * The score is calculated by considering each row as a binary number and summing them up.
     * The method first flips the rows to make sure the leftmost column is all 1s, as this maximizes the score.
     * Then, for each column, it counts the number of 1s and 0s and flips the column if there are more 0s than 1s.

     * @param grid The binary matrix represented as a 2D integer array.
     * @return The maximum score that can be obtained from the binary matrix.
