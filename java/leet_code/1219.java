/**
 * This class provides a solution for finding the maximum amount of gold that can be collected in a grid.
 * The grid is a 2D array where each cell represents a piece of gold. The goal is to find the path that collects the most gold.
 * The path can start and end at any cell in the grid, and can move up, down, left, or right from the current cell.
 * Each cell can only be visited once in a path.
