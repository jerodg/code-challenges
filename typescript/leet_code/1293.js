/**
 * Function to calculate the shortest path in a grid with obstacles.
 *
 * @param {number[][]} grid - The grid represented as a 2D array of numbers. Each cell in the grid is either 0 (free)
 *     or 1 (obstacle).
 * @param {number} k - The maximum number of obstacles that can be eliminated.
 * @returns {number} - The minimum number of steps to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid from the top-left
 *     corner. If it is not possible to reach the bottom-right corner, returns -1.
 *
 * The function uses dynamic programming and memoization to calculate the shortest path. It starts from the top-left
 *     corner of the grid and tries to move to the bottom-right corner. At each step, it can move to the right or down.
 *     If it encounters an obstacle, it can choose to eliminate it. The number of obstacles that can be eliminated is
 *     limited by the parameter `k`.
