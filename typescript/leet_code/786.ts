/**
 * Function to find the kth smallest prime fraction from an array of numbers.
 *
 * @param arr - An array of numbers.
 * @param k - The kth smallest prime fraction to find.
 * @returns An array containing the numerator and denominator of the kth smallest prime fraction.
 *
 * The function works by using a binary search approach to find the kth smallest prime fraction.
 * It starts by initializing the left and right boundaries of the search, and the mid-point.
 * It then enters a loop where it calculates the total number of fractions that are less than or equal to mid,
 * and the maximum fraction that is less than or equal to mid.
 * If the total number of fractions is equal to k, it returns the maximum fraction.
 * If the total number of fractions is greater than k, it adjusts the right boundary to mid.
 * If the total number of fractions is less than k, it adjusts the left boundary to mid.
 * The loop continues until the left boundary is greater than the right boundary.
 * The function then returns the maximum fraction found.
