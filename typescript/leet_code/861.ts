/**
 * Function to calculate the maximum binary matrix score.
 *
 * @param grid - A 2D array of numbers representing a binary matrix.
 * @returns The maximum score that can be achieved by flipping the matrix.
 *
 * The function works by first flipping all rows that start with 0, then counts the number of 0s in each column.
 * The score is calculated by adding the maximum of either the count of 0s or the total rows minus the count of 0s,
 * multiplied by 2 to the power of the number of columns minus the current column index minus 1, to the initial score.
 * The initial score is calculated as the number of rows multiplied by 2 to the power of the number of columns minus 1.
