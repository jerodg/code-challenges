# Fullstack Challenge Client

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Development

This application is built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
PORT=5001 npm run dev
```

With the Flask app running, navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```
