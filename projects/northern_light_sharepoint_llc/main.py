    """
    Compare two files and write the unique lines from each file to two separate output files.

    This function takes in four arguments: two input file paths and two output file paths.
    It reads the input files line by line, compares them, and writes the unique lines to the output files.
    The function uses sets to store the lines from each file. The difference between two sets in Python gives the elements
    present in the first set but not in the second.
    This is used to find the unique lines in each file. The unique lines are then written to the output files.

    Args:
        file0 (str): Path to the first input file.
        file1 (str): Path to the second input file.
        output0 (str): Path to the first output file.
        output1 (str): Path to the second output file.

    Returns:
        None

    Raises:
        IOError: An error occurred while processing the files.
