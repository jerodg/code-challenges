     * Find the Kth smallest prime fraction in an array.
     *
     * This method uses a binary search approach to find the Kth smallest prime fraction in an array.
     * It iterates over the array, comparing each element with the mid-point of the current search range.
     * If the current element divided by the next element is greater than the mid-point, it increments the
     * count and updates the max fraction.
     * If the count is equal to K, it returns the max fraction.
     * If the count is less than K, it updates the left boundary of the search range to the mid-point.
     * If the count is greater than K, it updates the right boundary of the search range to the mid-point.
     *
     * @param array $arr The array of integers.
     * @param int $k The Kth smallest prime fraction to find.
     * @return array The Kth smallest prime fraction, or an empty array if not found.
