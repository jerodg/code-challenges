/**
 * @file 1219.cpp
 * @brief This file contains the implementation of a solution for a problem related to finding the maximum gold in a grid.
 * @details The grid is represented as a 2D vector. Each cell in the grid represents a gold mine with a certain amount of gold.
 * The goal is to find the maximum amount of gold that can be collected by moving from one cell to another.
 * The movement is allowed only to the adjacent cells and once a cell is visited, it cannot be visited again.
 * The solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible paths and keeps track of the maximum gold collected.
