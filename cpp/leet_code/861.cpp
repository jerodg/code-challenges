/**
 * @file 861.cpp
 * @brief This file contains the implementation of a solution for a problem related to flipping a binary matrix to maximize its score.
 * @details The matrix is represented as a 2D vector. Each row in the matrix represents a binary number and the goal is to maximize the sum of these numbers.
 * The solution uses a greedy approach to flip the rows and columns of the matrix to maximize the score.
