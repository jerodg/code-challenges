// Package 1293
// This file contains the implementation of a solution to find the shortest path in a grid with obstacles.
// The grid is represented as a 2D vector, and the number of obstacles that can be eliminated is given.
// The solution uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path.

    // grid - A 2D vector representing the grid. A 0 represents an open cell, and a 1 represents an obstacle.
    // k - The number of obstacles that can be eliminated.
    //
    // Returns:
    // The length of the shortest path. If no path exists, it returns -1.
