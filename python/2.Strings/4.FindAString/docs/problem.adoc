== Tutorial
// todo: tutorial
In a list comprehension, we slide through bigger string by one position at a
time with the sliding window of length of smaller string. We can compute the
sliding count by substracting the length of smaller string from bigger string.
For each slide, we compare that part of bigger string with our smaller string
and generate 1 in a list if match found. Sum of all of these 1's in a list will
give us total number of matches found.
