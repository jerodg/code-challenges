== Tutorial
// todo: tutorial
Python 3
print(input().title()) will not work because the question is asking to capitalise firse letter of each word keeping in mind that "if it is a letter". Title and Capitalise are different in function as:

'abcd'.title()
results in 'Abcd' but

'12abcd'.title()
results in '12Abcd'. This is not what we want.

We just want to capitalise first letter of each word, not the first occuring letter of a word.
Instead, use this:
s = input()
for x in s[:].split():
    s = s.replace(x, x.capitalize())
print(s)
