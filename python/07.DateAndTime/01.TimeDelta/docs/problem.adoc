In this challenge, our goal is the first convert the time stamp to UNIX time stamps that are independent of timezones.
After that we simply subtract and print the difference.

To solve this in python you can use the python package called datetime and it has a function called strptime.
Using which we can get a time object.

Refer : datetime.strptime This tool returns a date time corresponding to a date string, parsed according to format.
