== Improvements
.Convention
* Improve documentation through use of doc strings
* Code formatting
* Missing encoding
* Missing main()
* Variable naming (fptr) ?

.Extraneous
* ar_count variable is unecessary
* Use of os.environ to output to screen is a bit ridiculous
** It is required only because there is an input that defines the array length which is also unecessary. We can reduce
the use of three lines of code by switching to print() and an additional import
* No need to define variable for results of function call as they are not used again
* Unused import: sys
* This entire problem
** Python does not differentiate between int and long data types, the same solution for 1_simple_array_sum can be used

.Pep8
* function names should be in lower case

.Syntax
* Missing pass in undefined function
