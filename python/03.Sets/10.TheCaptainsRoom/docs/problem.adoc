= 03.Sets/10.TheCaptainsRoom

== Learning
The approach to solve this problem follows:
1. Store List: Store the list in a variable. Let roomList be the variable
storing the list of room numbers.
2. Room Set: In the variable roomSet, store the set of roomList.
3. Sum Room Set and List: In the variable sumRoomSet and sumRoomList, store the
summations of roomSet and roomList, respectively.
4. Multiply K and Subtract: Now, we multiply __K__ with sumRoomSet, subtract the
 sumRoomList from it and then store the result in the variable temp. Therefore,
 temp = the Captain's room number __* (K - 1)__.
5. Divide by K-1: Divide temp by __(K - 1)__ and store the result in the
variable answer.
6. Output: Print answer.

== Tutorial
We simply calculate the difference in what the sum would be if there were K elements of all groups. We will have k-1*captains room number left, we simply didve by k-1 to get the answer.
