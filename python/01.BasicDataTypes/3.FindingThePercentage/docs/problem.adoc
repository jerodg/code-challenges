:summary: You have a record of _N_ students. Each record contains the student's name, and their percent marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry. The marks can be floating values. The user enters some integer _N_ followed by the names and marks for _N_ students. You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type. The user then enters a student's name. Output the average percentage marks obtained by that student, correct to two decimal places.

== Tutorial
// todo: improve tutorial

A dictionary is a data type which stores values in pairs. For each element in the dictionary, there is a unique key that points to a value. A dictionary is mutable. It can be changed.

.For example:
[source,python,linenums]
a_dict = {'one': 1} # Here 'one' is the key.

TIP: The key of a dictionary is immutable. We cannot use a list as a key because a list is mutable.

.We can, however, make a tuple of list and use as key.
[source,python,linenums]
a_dict['two'] = 2 # Adds key 'two' which points to 2
print a_dict['one']
# prints 1
if 'three' in a_dict:
    # To check whether a certain string exist as a key in the dictionary
    print a_dict['three']
else:
    print "Three not there"
# prints Three not there
del a_dict['one']
# Deletes index 'one' and the value associated with it
print a_dict
# prints {'two': 2}

TIP: A dictionary is unordered. So, only use the keys to navigate through the dictionary.
