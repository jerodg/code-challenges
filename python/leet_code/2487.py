        Removes nodes from the linked list based on certain conditions.

        The function first reverses the linked list. Then it iterates over the reversed list and creates a new list.
        While creating the new list, it only includes nodes whose value is greater than or equal to the maximum value seen so far.

        head : Optional[ListNode]
            head of the linked list
