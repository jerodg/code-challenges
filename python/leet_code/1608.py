        This method finds and returns the special value in the given list of integers.

        It sorts the list in ascending order and then iterates over the list, counting the number of elements that are greater than or equal to each possible value of x (from 1 to the length of the list). If it finds a value of x where the count is equal to x, it returns that value. If no such value is found, it returns -1.

        Parameters:
        nums (list[int]): The list of integers to search for the special value.

        Returns:
        int: The special value if found, otherwise -1.
