        Calculate the minimum number of swaps to balance a string of brackets.

        This function counts the number of unmatched opening brackets '[' and determines the minimum number of swaps
        needed to balance the string. A swap can balance two unmatched brackets.

        Args:
            s (str): The input string containing only '[' and ']' characters.

        Returns:
            int: The minimum number of swaps required to balance the string.
