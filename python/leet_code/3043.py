class Solution:
    """A class to solve the problem of finding the longest common prefix in two lists of integers.

    This class provides a method to determine the longest common prefix between two lists of integers
    by checking the prefixes of each integer in the lists.

        This function uses a set to store all prefixes of integers from the first list. It then iterates
        through the second list to find the longest common prefix by checking if any prefix of the integers
        in the second list exists in the set.

        Parameters:
            arr1 (list[int]): The first list of integers.
            arr2 (list[int]): The second list of integers.

        Returns:
            int: The length of the longest common prefix found between the two lists.

            >>> solution = Solution()
