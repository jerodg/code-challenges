Package leet_code

This module contains the Solution class which is used to solve the problem of partitioning a string 
into all possible palindrome substrings.

The Solution class has a constructor and a method named partition. The constructor initializes an 
empty dictionary to store intermediate results for memoization. The partition method takes a string 
as input and returns a list of all possible palindrome partitioning of the input string.

        The partition method takes a string as input and returns a list of all possible palindrome
        partitioning of the input string.

        This method uses a recursive approach to solve the problem. It checks if the current string
        is already computed and stored in the ans dictionary. If not, it computes the result by
        partitioning the string into all possible substrings and checking if they are palindromes.
        The results are then stored in the ans dictionary for future use.
