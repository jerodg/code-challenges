class Solution:
    """
    This class provides a solution for the problem. It has a method called maximumHappinessSum.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def maximumHappinessSum(happiness: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        """
        This method calculates the maximum happiness sum.

        It first sorts the happiness list in descending order. Then it checks if the kth child's
        happiness is greater than or equal to k-1.
        If it is, it returns the sum of the happiness of the first k children minus the sum of the
        first k-1 natural  numbers.
        If it's not, it calculates the sum of the happiness of each child minus their index
        (0-indexed) until the result is non-positive.

        Parameters:
        happiness (list[int]): A list of integers representing the happiness of each child.
        k (int): The number of children to consider.

        Returns:
        int: The maximum happiness sum.
