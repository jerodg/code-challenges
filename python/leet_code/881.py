def numRescueBoats(p: list[int], limit: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the minimum number of rescue boats needed.

    The function sorts the list of people's weights, then uses a two-pointer approach to find the minimum number of boats.
    It starts with the lightest and heaviest person, and if they can fit in one boat, it moves both pointers. If not, it only moves the pointer for the heaviest person.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : list[int]
        List of people's weights.
    limit : int
        Maximum weight a boat can carry.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        Minimum number of boats needed.
