This module contains a solution for finding the maximum safeness factor in a grid.
The grid is represented as a 2D list, where 0 represents a safe cell and 1 represents an unsafe cell.
The safeness factor of a cell is the minimum distance to an unsafe cell.
The maximum safeness factor is the maximum of the safeness factors of the cells in the path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell.
