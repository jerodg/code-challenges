Package leet_code

This module contains the Solution class which is used to solve the problem of finding the sum of all possible XOR of subsets of a given list of numbers.

The Solution class has a constructor and a method named subsetXORSum. The subsetXORSum method takes a list of integers as input and returns an integer which is the sum of all possible XOR of subsets of the input list.

        The subsetXORSum method takes a list of integers as input and returns an integer which is the sum of all possible XOR of subsets of the input list.

        Parameters:
            nums (list[int]): the input list of integers.

        Returns:
            int: the sum of all possible XOR of subsets of the input list.

        This method uses a bitwise OR operation to find the XOR of all numbers in the list. It then shifts the result to the left by (n - 1) places, where n is the length of the list. This is equivalent to multiplying the result by 2^(n - 1), which gives the sum of all possible XOR of subsets of the list.
