    This class provides a method to determine the minimum number of extra characters

        This function uses dynamic programming to find the minimum number of extra characters
        required to form the string `s` using the words in the provided dictionary. It iterates
        through the string and checks for possible word matches from the dictionary, updating
        the dynamic programming table accordingly.

        Parameters:
            s (str): The input string to be formed.
            dictionary (list[str]): A list of words that can be used to form the string `s`.

        Returns:
            int: The minimum number of extra characters needed to form the string `s`.

        Example:
            >>> solution = Solution()
            >>> solution.minExtraChar("leetcode", ["leet", "code"])
