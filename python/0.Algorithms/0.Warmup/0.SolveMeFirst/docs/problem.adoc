== Improvements
.Convention
* Improve documentation through use of doc strings
* Code formatting
* Missing shebang
* Missing encoding
* Missing if __name__ == main
* Missing main()

.Extraneous
* ar_count variable is unecessary
* Use of os.environ to output to screen is a bit ridiculous
** It is required only because there is an input that defines the array length which is also unecessary. We can reduce
the use of three lines of code by switching to print() and an additional import
* No need to define variable for results of function call as they are not used again
* Unused import: sys

.Pep8
* Function names should be lowercase

.Syntax
* Missing pass in undefined function
