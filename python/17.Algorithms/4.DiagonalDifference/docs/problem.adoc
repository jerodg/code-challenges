We need to calculate the sums across the two diagonals of a square matrix. Along the first diagonal of the matrix, row index = column index. The second diagonal is at column  for each row . Loop through the rows, summing both values as  increments.

Python 3
def diagonalDifference(arr):
    # Write your code here, O(n)
    #l, r = left sum, right sum
    l, r = 0, 0
    # single pass, grab both values
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        l += arr[i][i]
        r += arr[i][-i-1]
    return abs(l-r)
