You are working on an application for manipulating GUI windows on a screen.

Each window is represented by four parameters (X, Y, W, H), all measured in pixels.
X and Y are the coordinates of the window's lower-left corner, W is the window's width, and H is the window's height.

Rectangle Parameters The users of your application specify the properties of a window using a window string, such as "X=10 Y=20 W=30 H=40".
A window string is valid if all the following properties are satisfied:

It is formatted as X=# Y=# W=# H=#, where each parameter X, Y, W, H is specified exactly once, and any permutation of the parameters is allowed.
X and Y are integers, positive or negative.
W and H are integers, equal or greater than 0.
For example:
"X=-10 H=30 Y=20 W=40" and "H=40 W=30 Y=0 X=10" are valid window strings.
"X=10.5 Y=20 W=-30 H=40", "X=10 Y=20", and "X=10,Y=20,W=30,H=40" are invalid window strings.
You are working on the function answer, which computes the area of a window specified by a window string, or returns -1 if the window string is invalid.

Currently, the answer function has some bugs.
Fix this function so that it works as desired.
