== Learning
* https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions[PyDocs - Data Structures/List Comprehensions]
* https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/controlflow.html#the-range-function[PyDocs - Control Flow/The range() Functions]

== Tutorial
// todo: rewrite
It is in lexographical order due to the nature of the loops. Spaced out it looks
 somewhat like:
[source,python,linenums]
for a in range(x+1):
    for b in range(y+1):
        for c in range(z+1):
            if a + b + c != n:
                print('stuff is here')

We start at [0,0,0]. Then c will increment to get to [0,0,1] When c hits
[0,0,z], we get [0,1,0] as the next in the loop. This pattern continues and
gives us the lexographical ordering required of the output.

== Improving the Template
* Combine inputs/declarations into one line
