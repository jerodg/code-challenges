== Tutorial
// todo: improve tutorial
When we talk about storing multiple values in a container-like data structure,
the first thing that comes to mind is a list.

.You can initialize a list as
[source,python,linenums]
arr = list()

.or simply
[source,python,linenums]
arr = []

.or with a few elements as
[source,python,linenums]
arr = [1,2,3]

.Elements can be accessed easily similar to most programming languages:
[source,python,linenums]
print arr[0]  # result is 1
print arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]  # result is 6

Lists in Python are very versatile. You can add almost anything in a Python
list.

In Python, you can create a list of any objects: strings, integers, or even
lists. You can even add multiple types in a single list!

Let's look at some of the methods you can use on list.

=== append(x)
Adds a single element x to the end of a list.

[source,python,linenums]
arr.append(9)
print(arr)  # prints [1, 2, 3, 9]

=== extend(L)
Merges another list L to the end.

arr.extend([10,11])
print arr
# prints [1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11]

=== insert(i, x)
Inserts element x at position i.

arr.insert(3,7)
print arr
# prints [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11]

=== remove(x)
Removes the first occurrence of element x.

arr.remove(10)
arr
# prints [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 11]

=== pop()
Removes the last element of a list. If an argument is passed, that index item is popped out.

temp = arr.pop()
print temp
# prints 11

=== index(x)
Returns the first index of a value in the list. Throws an error if it's not found.

temp = arr.index(3)
print temp
# prints 2

 ===count(x)
Counts the number of occurrences of an element x.

temp = arr.count(1)
print temp
# prints 1

=== sort()
Sorts the list.

arr.sort()
print arr
# [1, 2, 3, 7, 9]

=== reverse()
Reverses the list.

arr.reverse()
print arr
# [9, 7, 3, 2, 1]
