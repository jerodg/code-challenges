== Improving the Problem

Sample Input contains spaces in the code block; these appear to be unintentional.
While the tests don't account for spaces at the end, code could potentially return unacceptable results when copy/pasted with the spaces.

* remove spaces from code block or add .strip() to problem and tutorial

== Improving the Template

=== Convention

.Missing
* shebang
* encoding
* doc-comments
* pass in undefined function

=== Extraneous

N/A

=== Pep8

* No new-line at end of file
* Expecting two blank lines after function

=== Syntax
