== Improving the Problem

At the very end of the problem it states in the example:

"The second lowest grade of 37.21 belongs to both Harry and Berry, so we order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.""

What to do in the event of a tie (print both and order alphabetically by name) is a significant requirement and should be stated clearly in the problem rather than incidentally in the example.
