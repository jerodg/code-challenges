== Tutorial
Loops are control structures that iterate over a range to perform a certain task.

There are two kinds of loops in Python.

A for loop:
[source,python,linenums]
for i in range(0, 5):
    print i

And a while loop:
[source,python,linenums]
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print i
    i += 1

NOTE: Be careful about indentation in Python.

The term range(0,5) returns a list of integers from 0 up to but not including 5
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4].
