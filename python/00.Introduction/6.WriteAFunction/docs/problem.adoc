== Tutorial
// todo: improve tutorial

TIP: Order of operator precedence: not > and > or.
This defines the order in which the interpreter evaluates expressions.

For the learners: you should know that doing something like the setup for this challenge inclines you to do is a bad practice.

.Please, No!
[source,python,linenums]
def f():
  if condition:
    return True
  else:
    return False

This is simply unnecessary.
You are returning a boolean, so why even use if blocks in the first place?

.A Better Approach
[source,python,linenums]
def f():
	return condition

Because this already evaluates as a boolean.
So in this challenge, forget about ifs and elses, and that leap variable.

// todo: this is the answer and needs to be replaced
.Just do the following
[source,python,linenums]
def is_leap(year):
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 400 == 0 or year % 100 != 0)

NOTE: Don't be redundant, be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)].

== Improving the Template

=== Convention

.Missing
* shebang
* encoding
* doc-comments
* type-hinting for function return

=== Extraneous

.Unnecessary variable definition
* Since *_year_* is only being used once we don't need to assign it to a variable first

=== Pep8

* No new-line at end of file

=== Syntax

N/A
