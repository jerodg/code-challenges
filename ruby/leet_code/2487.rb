# This file contains the implementation of the `ListNode` class and the `remove_nodes` function.
# The `ListNode` class is used to create nodes for a linked list, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node.
# The `remove_nodes` function is used to remove nodes from a linked list that have a smaller value than the next node.

# Class representing a node in a linked list.
# Each node contains a value and a reference to the next node.
class ListNode
  attr_accessor :val, :next

  # Initializes a new instance of the ListNode class.
  #
  # @param val [Number] the value of the node
  # @param _next [ListNode, nil] the next node in the linked list
  def initialize(val = 0, _next = nil)
    @val = val
    @next = _next
  end
end

# Removes nodes from a linked list that have a smaller value than the next node.
#
# The function uses a recursive approach to traverse the linked list from the end to the start.
# If the value of the current node is smaller than the value of the next node, the current node is removed.
#
# @param head [ListNode] the head of the linked list
# @return [ListNode] the head of the linked list after removing nodes
