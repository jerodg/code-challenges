# This file contains the implementation of the `num_rescue_boats` function
# which calculates the minimum number of boats required to rescue all people
# given their weights and the weight limit of each boat. It also includes
# a helper function `sorted?` to check if an array is sorted.

# Checks if an array is sorted in ascending order.
#
# @param array [Array<Number>] the array to check
# @return [Boolean] true if the array is sorted, false otherwise
def sorted?(array)
  array.each_cons(2).all? { |a, b| a <= b }
end

# Calculates the minimum number of boats required to rescue all people.
#
# The function sorts the array of people's weights, then uses a two-pointer
# technique to iterate from both ends of the array towards the middle.
# This approach ensures that the minimum number of boats is used, as it
# always tries to pair the lightest person with the heaviest person.
#
# @param people [Array<Number>] the weights of the people to rescue
# @param limit [Number] the weight limit of each boat
# @return [Number] the minimum number of boats required
