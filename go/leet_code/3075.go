// maximumHappinessSum is a function that calculates the maximum sum of happiness that can be achieved
// by selecting k elements from a list of happiness values. The happiness values are sorted in ascending
// order and the function selects the k largest values. If a happiness value is negative, it is not
// included in the sum. The function returns the maximum sum as an int64.
//
// Parameters:
// happiness: A slice of integers representing the happiness values.
// k: An integer representing the number of elements to select.
//
// Returns:
// The maximum sum of happiness that can be achieved.
