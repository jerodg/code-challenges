// the rows and columns of a binary matrix. The score of a matrix is defined as the sum of its
// elements, where each row of the matrix is interpreted as a binary number.

// Parameters:
// grid: A 2D slice of integers representing the binary matrix.
//
// Returns:
// The maximum score that can be achieved.
