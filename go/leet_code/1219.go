// getMaximumGold is a function that calculates the maximum amount of gold that can be collected
// from a grid. The grid is a 2D slice of integers where each integer represents the amount of gold
// at that location. The function traverses the grid, starting from each cell that contains gold,
// and collects gold along the way. The traversal stops when it hits a cell with no gold or a cell
// that has been visited before. The function returns the maximum amount of gold that can be collected.
//
// Parameters:
// grid: A 2D slice of integers representing the grid.
//
// Returns:
// The maximum amount of gold that can be collected.

	// sol is the variable that keeps track of the maximum amount of gold collected so far.
