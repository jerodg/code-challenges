// kthSmallestPrimeFraction is a function that calculates the k-th smallest prime fraction from a sorted list of prime numbers.
// A fraction is defined as a number of the form a/b where a and b are both integers and b != 0. A prime fraction is a fraction
// where both a and b are prime numbers. The function uses a binary search algorithm to find the k-th smallest prime fraction.
//
// Parameters:
// arr: A slice of integers representing the sorted list of prime numbers.
// k: An integer representing the k-th smallest prime fraction to find.
//
// Returns:
// A slice of two integers representing the k-th smallest prime fraction. The first integer is the numerator and the second integer is the denominator.
