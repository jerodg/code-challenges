## Python
#### Conventions
It's an old practice to use underscore (_) for unused index/iterator 
variable so that variables like i or j which are commonly used 
for indexing purposes are not eaten up unnecessarily.
Moreover, this has the added benefit of hinting that the particular 
index variable is unused in the code.
