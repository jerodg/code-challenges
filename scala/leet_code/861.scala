  /**
   * This function calculates the maximum score a binary matrix can have by flipping rows and columns.
   * The score of a binary matrix is the sum of its elements, where each element in the ith row and jth column contributes 2^(n-j-1) to the score, n being the number of columns.
   * The row flips are performed first, each row of the matrix is flipped such that the first element of each row is 1.
   * Then, each column is flipped if the number of 0s is more than the number of 1s in that column.
   *
   * @param grid The input binary matrix.
   * @return The maximum possible score of the binary matrix after flipping.
