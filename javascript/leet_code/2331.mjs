 * This file `2331.mjs` contains a class `TreeNode` and a function `evaluateTree`.
 * The `TreeNode` class is used to create a binary tree node with a value and optional left and right child nodes.
 * The `evaluateTree` function evaluates the binary tree according to the following rules:
 * - If a node is a leaf (has no children), it is evaluated as true if its value is 1 and false otherwise.
 * - If a node has a value of 2, it is evaluated as the logical OR of its children.
 * - If a node has a value of 3, it is evaluated as the logical AND of its children.
