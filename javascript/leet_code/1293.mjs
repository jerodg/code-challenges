/**
 * Package leet_code

 * This file `1293.mjs` contains a function `shortestPath` that calculates the shortest path in a grid from the

 * represents whether a cell is an obstacle (1) or not (0). The function uses breadth-first search (BFS) to find the
 * shortest path. The path can go through up to `k` obstacles.
