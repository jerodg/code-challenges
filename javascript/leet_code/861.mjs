/**
 * Calculates the maximum score after flipping.
 *
 * The function first calculates the initial score assuming all rows have been flipped such that their first element is
 * 1. Then, for each column starting from the second, it counts the number of 1s in the column (considering that rows
 * can be flipped). The score of the column is the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 0s (since we can
 * flip the entire column if it contains more 0s than 1s), multiplied by the column's weight. The column's weight is a
 * power of 2, decreasing from left to right. The function finally returns the total score.
 *
 * @param {number[][]} grid - A m x n binary matrix.
 * @returns {number} The maximum score after flipping.
